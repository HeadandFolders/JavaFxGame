Part 1: Project Objectives
A simple game consisting of 5 levels using the Java language and Javafx library.
This was a 2person team project. I was responsible for the Accounts (including signup/login pages and database) and Levels 4 and 5. 

Part 2: Account 
• Users should be able to log in or sign up, with a check in place to prevent duplicate 
accounts. 
• Once logged in, users can view their personal information, including the number of 
levels won, time taken, and the total completions of all 5 levels.
• Implement a feature that allows users to add a profile picture. 
• A successful account creation animation can be included for a user-friendly 
experience.

Part 3: levels 
• Implement a timer to calculate the time taken to complete the entire game. 
• Each level should have its own timer as well. 

Level 1: GEEK-GAMER.
• The first level requires the user to solve a series of quizzes.
• Quizzes consist of multiple-choice questions or questions where the user must type 
the answer. 
• Questions can be presented in text or image format.
• Questions and answers should be extracted from your database. 
• To successfully complete the level, all questions must be answered correctly. You 
should include at least 10 questions.
• Questions can be related to the course material or be creatively designed.
• Scoring: Correctly guessing the answer on the first try earns 10 points. Subsequent 
guesses deduct 3 points. If the correct answer is achieved after the second guess, 
award 7 points instead of 10.

Level 2: Balloon Assassinator.
• In this level, the user is prompted to choose one out of four predetermined colors.
• The objective is to shoot down all balloons of the chosen color as they move 
randomly on the screen.
• Implement an animated pistol that follows the mouse movement. 
• When a balloon is clicked, it should fade out with a pop sound. 
• Scoring: Each correctly popped balloon earns 10 points. Selecting the wrong 
balloon results in a deduction of 5 points. 
• Use ellipses to create the balloons.

Level 3: Focus Freak 
• This level requires high concentration. Users will encounter cards, each displaying 
one of two different shapes with varying stroke colors. Two boxes will be placed 
below, each labeled with the name of a shape.
• The user's task is to quickly drag and drop each card into the correct box. 
• The challenge must be completed within 15 seconds. 
• Scoring: Correctly classifying each card adds 10 points to the score, while an 
incorrect classification deducts 5 points.

Level 4: Stress Out 
• Implement a rotating circle at a medium speed. 
• The circle has a red dot on its stroke, which changes color between red and green.
• When the circle turns green, the user must press 'g' on the keyboard.
• The color will revert to red after 2 seconds.
• Scoring: Clicking on time adds 10 points to the score, while a miss results in a 
deduction of 5 points.

• At this level, users have 30 seconds to navigate a challenging parkour.
• The parkour includes obstacles that require either jumping (press 'space') or sliding 
(press 'D'). 
• Scoring: Each successful jump earns 10 points, while a failed attempt deducts 5 
points.
